* Quick start

Each line should start with the name of the faction that's doing
stuff, followed by a colo. After this, you can have multiple commands
that apply to that faction, separated by full stops. For example:

Nomads: Dig 1. D -> E7

The exact capitalization doesn't matter. 

The commands that you'd usually use are:

- Pass Bon2
  Pass, return current bonus tile, and replace it with Bon2.

- Leech 2
  Have the Nomads trade 1 vp for 2 power

- Action ACT5
  Take the power action 5 (or stronghold, bonus tile, or favor special
  action).

- Dig 1
  Trade workers / priests to shovels at the appropriate exchange rate.
  The shovels need to be spent by commands later on the same line.

- D -> F5
  Terraform the hex F5 into the correct terrain type, and build a dwelling
  there.

- TP -> F5
  Replace the dwelling in F5 with a trading post (TE for temples, SH for
  strongholds, SA for sanctuaries).

- P -> FIRE1
  Send a priest to the first spot on the fire cult track.

- F5:black
  Terraform F5 to black, but don't build anything there.

- +FAV11
  Take the Favor tile #11. (TW3 for Town tile 3, you shouldn't take
  Bonus tiles with +, but use the Pass command)

- Bridge E9:D6
  Build a bridge from E9 to D6.

- Income
  Take all income (buildings, favors, bonus tiles, last turn's special
  scoring tile). Note -- should be done just before starting a new round.

- Start
  Move to the next round.

* Notes on specific factions:

- Dwarves, Fakirs:

Since adjancy isn't tracked, there's no special representation of
tunneling / carpet flight. Just use a command like "-2w. +4vp" to
get the correct effect.
  
- Alchemists:

There's no special support for the VP / money conversion. Use a command
like "-4vp. +2c".
