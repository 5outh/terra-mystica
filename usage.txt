* Setting up a game

For now you'll need to ask Juho to create a game. You'll get two links:
one for viewing the game, one for editing it. Anyone with the second link
can change the game in arbitrary ways, so you might not want to share it
too widely.

During setup, you'll need the following sections in the game file:

Remove randonly selected bonus tiles from the game, e.g.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  delete bon9
  delete bon6
#+END_EXAMPLE

Tell which score tiles are in the game, and in which order:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  score score4, score2, score8, score7, score6, score5
#+END_EXAMPLE

Select the factions in play:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  # Faction selection
  setup Nomads
  setup Auren
  setup Swarmlings
#+END_EXAMPLE

Place initial dwellings:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Nomads: Build A5
  Auren: Build F4
  Swarmlings: Build H4. Build G6
  Auren: Build F2
  Nomads: Build B4. Build G7
#+END_EXAMPLE

Select initial bonus tiles:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Swarmlings: +Bon8
  Auren: +Bon2
  Nomads: +Bon5
#+END_EXAMPLE

Get first round's income:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  # Round 1 income 
  Nomads: income
  Auren: income
  Swarmlings: income
#+END_EXAMPLE

Start the game:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  start
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Commands

Each line should start with the name of the faction that's doing
stuff, followed by a colon. After this, you can have multiple commands
that apply to that faction, separated by full stops. For example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Nomads: Dig 1. Build E7
#+END_EXAMPLE

The exact capitalization doesn't matter. 

The commands that you'd usually use are:

** =pass= /tile/

Example: =pass bon2=

Pass, return current bonus tile, and replace it with Bon2. When passing
on the last turn.

** =leech= /amount/

Example: =Leech 2=.

Trade 1 vp for 2 power

** =action= /label/

Example: =action act5.

Take the power action 5 (or stronghold, bonus
tile, or favor special action).

** =dig= /amount/

Example: =dig 1=. 

Trade workers / priests to shovels at the appropriate exchange rate.
The shovels need to be spent by commands later on the same line.

** =build= /location/

Example: =build F5=

Terraform the hex F5 into the correct terrain type, and build a
dwelling there.

** =upgrade= /location/ to /building/

Example: =upgrade F5 to TP=

Replace the dwelling in F5 with a trading post (TE for temples, SH for
strongholds, SA for sanctuaries).

** =send P to= /cult/

Example: =Send P to Fire=

Send a priest to the first free spot on the fire cult track.

** =transform= /location/ =to= /color/

Example: =transform F5 to black=

Terraform F5 to black, but don't build anything there.

** =convert= /amount/ /resource/ to /amount/ /resource/

Example: =convert 3pw to 1w=

Convert between resources.

** =burn= /amount/

Example: =burn 2=

Remove 2 power from bowl 2, and move 2 power from bowl 2 to 3.

** + /amount/ /resource/ or - /amount/ /resource/

Example: =+FAV11=

Take the Favor tile #11. (TW3 for Town tile 3, you shouldn't take
Bonus tiles with +, but use the Pass command). 

Example: =-4w=

Return 4 workers from the treasury to the pool.

** =bridge= /location:location/

Example: =Bridge E9:D6=

Build a bridge from E9 to D6.

** =advance= /track/

Example: =advance ship=

Advance 1 step on the shipping track. "Advance dig" for improving the
shovel track.

** =income=

Take all income (buildings, favors, bonus tiles, last turn's special
scoring tile). Note -- should be done just before starting a new round.

** =start=

Move to the next round.

** =finish=

Do the final scoring.




* Notes on specific factions

** Mermaids

The mermaid special town founding ability can't be used automatically,
but must be triggered manually. Use the =connect= command to mark
hexes that should be considered adjacent for this purpose. For example
if the mermaids declare the river hex between F2 and E4 as the one
they want to skip, use the command =connect F2:E4=). If you want to
connect to multiple hexes bordering that river hex, you need to issue
separate commands. 

The tracker doesn't yet check these commands for validity -- e.g. it
doesn't check that one town has these special connections over only
one river hex.
