* Resources

Most playing pieces are represented as resources, that can be located
either in a faction's treasury, the map, or the pool. The full list of
resources (and the abbreviations you need to use) is:

 Resources:
   C      Coin
   W      Worker
   P      Priest
   PW     Power (in general -- use P1 / P2 / P3 if you need to refer to
                 power in a specific bowl)
   VP     Victory points

 Buildings:
   D      Dwelling
   TP     Trading post
   TE     Temple
   SH     Stronghold
   SA     Sanctuary

 Tiles:

   BonX   Bonus tile #X
   FavX   Favor tile #X

* Locations

The following locations exist in the game:

  - Map hexes (e.g. E9)
  - Cult track priest spots (e.g. FIRE1)

* Commands

Anything between a # and the end of the line is a comment, and ignored.
Every line can contain a number of commands, seperate with a dot. Example:

  Setup nomads. Setup alchemists.

If the row starts with a faction name followed by a colon, the commands
of that row will apply to that faction. Example:

  Nomads: D -> A5. -1W. -2C.

The case of characters doesn't matter. You can use upper and lower case
however you want.

Commands that don't require a faction:

  Setup X  # Add faction X to the game

  Block X  # Mark action space X as used

  Clear    # Mark all action spaces as available

  Delete X # Permanently remove a piece from the pool

  X:Y      # Transform map location X to the color Y (e.g. E5:red)

Commands that require a faction:

  +XY      # Move X units of resource Y from the pool to the faction treasury.
  -XY      # The opposite (e.g. -1W. -2C. +5VP)

  X -> Y   # Swap contents of location Y with a piece X from the faction
           # (e.g. TP -> E5)

  Leech X  # Gain X power, lose X-1 VPs

  Burn X   # Lose X power to the pool from bowl 2, move X power from bowl 2
           # to bowl 3.
