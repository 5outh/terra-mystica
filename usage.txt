* Commands

Each line should start with the name of the faction that's doing
stuff, followed by a colon. After this, you can have multiple commands
that apply to that faction, separated by full stops. For example:

  Nomads: Dig 1. Build E7

The exact capitalization doesn't matter. 

The commands that you'd usually use are:

- Pass Bon2
  Pass, return current bonus tile, and replace it with Bon2.

- Leech 2
  Trade 1 vp for 2 power

- Action ACT5
  Take the power action 5 (or stronghold, bonus tile, or favor special
  action).

- Dig 1
  Trade workers / priests to shovels at the appropriate exchange rate.
  The shovels need to be spent by commands later on the same line.

- Build F5
  Terraform the hex F5 into the correct terrain type, and build a dwelling
  there.

- Upgrade F5 to TP
  Replace the dwelling in F5 with a trading post (TE for temples, SH for
  strongholds, SA for sanctuaries).

- Send P to FIRE
  Send a priest to the first free spot on the fire cult track.

- Transform F5 to black
  Terraform F5 to black, but don't build anything there.

- +FAV11
  Take the Favor tile #11. (TW3 for Town tile 3, you shouldn't take
  Bonus tiles with +, but use the Pass command)

- Bridge E9:D6
  Build a bridge from E9 to D6.

- Advance ship
  Advance 1 step on the shipping track. "Advance dig" for improving the
  shovel track.

- Income
  Take all income (buildings, favors, bonus tiles, last turn's special
  scoring tile). Note -- should be done just before starting a new round.

- Start
  Move to the next round.

* Notes on specific factions:

- Dwarves, Fakirs:

Since adjancy isn't tracked, there's no special representation of
tunneling / carpet flight. Just use a command like "-2w. +4vp" to
get the correct effect.
