- Automatic conversion of resources -> money -> VPs in endgame

Maybe:
- Detect leeching opportunities:
  - Require an explicit leech / don't leech Detect
  - reject invalid leech amounts
- Track bridge counts

Out of scope:
- Any other spatial elements
  - Automatic founding of towns
  - Final network scoring
  - Tracking of active player
