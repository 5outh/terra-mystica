Definitely:
- User accounts:
  - Login via OAuth using Google (and maybe Facebook?) account
  - Allow marking factions as belonging to a specific account
  - Allow marking accounts as admins of a specific game
  - Show link to edit page for admins of each game
  - Have a page that lists all games an account plays in / admins
    - Probably also show the summary of what actions are waiting in the game
- UI for creating games
  - Only for logged in users
  - Automatically set up the bonus tiles / scoring tiles (can still be edited)
  - Figure out the namespace issues for PBF vs. private PBEM games
- Fix the strange simultaneous favor tile / town sequencing 
- Rationalize reference to resources (right now there are competing forms:
  "1w", "1 w", "1 W". 
- Color-code all references to cults
- Make naming match official rulebook terms
  - Shovel -> spade
  - Trading post -> Trading house
  - Others?

Maybe:
- Always require an explicit leech / don't leech decision
- Reject invalid leech amounts
- Track unused bridge count
- Add more info to the building slideout. At least the production added
  by next building of that sort. Maybe also the one-time gains from building
  it.

Out of scope:
- General UI for entering moves
- Email notifications
